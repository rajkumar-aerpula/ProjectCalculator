3.2.Architecture:
Architecture document design for your project;
In our previous article, we have talked about a Calculator app we are going to develop and also have seen a glimpse of our final project. In this article, we will get our hands ready to start the development of our first application. We have told this earlier also that every application we will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. We can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI. So let’s now try to break down the UI of calculator App into smaller pieces. We will get the following elements after breaking the UI into small pieces:
Calculator Title: This is the title at the top of our application, “GeeksforGeeks Calculator”.
Output Screen: This will be our output screen, where all text will be shown. Like the input that the user will type and the answer calculated from the user input. So, we can again break down this into two smaller pieces as shown below:
Question Output: This will be the input given by the user.
Answer Output: This will be the result calculated from user input.
Buttons: As you have seen in the image of our calculator app, we had used a lot of buttons for the input numbers from ‘0-9’, operators, to clear the screen, for backspace etc.
